## Introduction
The TSCZ Business Automation System serves as a comprehensive solution for streamlining key business processes, such as requesting cash, managing vehicle allocations for organizational trips, and handling trip advances. This system enhances approval workflows for requisitions, enabling businesses to complete these tasks efficiently and within a shorter timeframe. By leveraging paperless solutions, it promotes operational efficiency and sustainability.

Additionally, the documentation enables users to perform various tasks, including fuel requests, vehicle requests, fuel allocations, trip advances, crafting local claims, and handling educational allowances. It also covers processes for managing salary advances and tracking the lifecycle of requests as they progress through the approval workflow. Through this system, managers and department heads can approve, reject, or put requests on hold, providing employees with a streamlined and manageable process for handling their submissions.

Conclusively, the documentation also includes a reporting section where users can view attachments or files linked to each request, as well as the number of requisitions made by each department. This feature supports decision-making by providing insights into resource acquisition, usage, and tracking within the organization. Additionally, an audit trail is available to enhance accountability, allowing authorized personnel or management to review all records and track the movement of resources for auditing purposes.
